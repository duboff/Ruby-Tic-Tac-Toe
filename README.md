Ruby-Tic-Tac-Toe
================
This was my first piece of working ruby code. As such it is not written in a TDD way, without proper OOP design and before I learned about Git. I decided to put it here to remind myself where I started from.

The Game
================

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. You can choose single or multiplayer mode and the size of the board. 

Computer just plays randomly.

There is a score board functionality.

To run:

```
$ ruby TicTac.rb
```

And the game will start automatically.
